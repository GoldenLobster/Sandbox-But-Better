This is basically the same game that mandaw created, just with some extra sauce

## Features added:

- multiplayer(still a bit of a work in progress, it works, sometimes)
- settings menu(change keybinds)
- jump height changed
- various bug fixes(cross platform did not work, obj files didnt work, constant crashes etc..)
- a small map change(more to come)
- death animation added
- moved crosshair to make up for the inacuracy of the bullet shooting


## stuff i wanna do

theres this bug, everytime i open the game it makes a big sound, it kinda sounds like all the sound assets playing all at once. i wanna fix this

i wanna add more maps, better maps

good multiplayer(mine is still a work in progress)

more animations(reload, aiming etc)

probably more stuff will come to mind but idk
